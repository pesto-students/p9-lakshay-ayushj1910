## What is a Browser? ##

Web browser is software application used to access information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests some information, the web browser fetches the data from a web server and then displays the webpage on the userâ€™s screen.

## Functionalities of a Browser ##

A browser's main functionality is to provide a way for users to access and interact with information and resources on the World Wide Web. It does this by interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and rendering the resulting web pages. Some of the key functions of a browser include:

- Displaying web pages: The browser is responsible for displaying web pages, including text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.

- Navigation: Browsers provide a way for users to navigate the web, including functions such as forward, backward, and refresh buttons, as well as the ability to bookmark and save favorite pages.

- Interactivity: Browsers allow users to interact with web pages and web-based applications, including the ability to fill out forms, submit information, and use various types of multimedia content.


- Debugging and Development: Browsers also have built-in tools for debugging and developing web pages and applications, including the ability to inspect HTML and CSS code, as well as test JavaScript and other scripting languages.


## Main components of a Browser ##

- User interface: The user interface is the part of the browser that the user interacts with, including the address bar, navigation buttons, tabs, and menus.

- Rendering engine: The rendering engine is responsible for interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and rendering the resulting web pages.

- JavaScript engine: The JavaScript engine is responsible for executing JavaScript code and providing dynamic interactivity on web pages.

- Networking layer: The networking layer handles the communication between the browser and the server, including sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses.

- Browser cache: The browser cache is a local storage area where the browser stores frequently accessed web content, such as images and stylesheets, to speed up page loading times.


## Rendering Engine ##

A rendering engine is a component of a web browser that is responsible for rendering web pages and displaying them to the user. It does this by interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and transforming it into a visual representation of the web page.


## Parsers (HTML, CSS, Javascript) ##

Parsers are software components that are used to process structured data and break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. In the context of web browsers, parsers are used to interpret and process the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that makes up a web page.

- HTML parser: An HTML parser is responsible for processing HTML code and constructing a Document Object Model (DOM) tree that represents the structure and content of the web page. The DOM tree is a hierarchical representation of the web page, with each node in the tree representing an element of the page, such as a heading, a paragraph, or an image. The browser uses the DOM tree to determine how to render the page and respond to user interactions.

- CSS parser: A CSS parser is responsible for processing CSS code and applying the styles defined in the code to the elements of the web page. The CSS parser is used to parse the CSS rules and build a cascade of styles that are used to determine the final appearance of the page elements.

- JavaScript parser: A JavaScript parser is responsible for processing JavaScript code and executing the code in response to various events on the web page, such as a button click or a page load. The JavaScript parser is used to interpret the code and perform actions that dynamically change the content and behavior of the web page.


## Script Processors ##

Script processors are software components that are responsible for executing code, typically in the form of scripts or programming languages. In the context of web browsers, script processors are used to execute JavaScript code, which is a widely used scripting language for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.


## Tree Construction ##

Tree construction is a process that takes place in web browsers when they parse and interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The process involves creating a hierarchical tree-like structure that represents the structure and content of the web page, known as the Document Object Model (DOM) tree.


## Order of script processing ##

- HTML parsing and DOM tree construction: The browser starts by parsing the HTML code and constructing the Document Object Model (DOM) tree, which represents the structure and content of the web page.

- CSS processing: The browser then processes the CSS code and applies the styles defined in the CSS to the elements in the DOM tree, updating their appearance as needed.

- Script execution: Finally, the browser executes any JavaScript code on the page. This can include code that is embedded in the HTML code, or code that is loaded from external sources.


## Layout and Painting ##

Layout and painting are two processes in web browsers that determine the size and position of elements on a web page and render them on the screen. Layout calculates the size and position of elements based on the styles and content, while painting is responsible for rendering the elements, including text, images, and backgrounds. These processes are triggered by changes to the page, such as changes to styles or content, and are optimized for performance. The output of the layout process is used by the painting process to accurately render the elements on the screen.
