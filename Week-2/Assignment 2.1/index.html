          The 2008 market crash, also known as the financial crisis of 2008, was
          the most serious economic crisis that happened in the early 21st
          century. It is considered to be the worst financial disaster since the
          Great Depression of the 1930s. This began in 2007 and grew into a
          full-blown international crisis.

          Immoderate risk-taking by financial institutions, housing bubble, and
          predatory lending targeting low-income groups were some factors that
          contributed to the market crash. This crisis began in the US and later
          spread to the whole world. The market crash of 2008 took only 18
          months to worsen the whole economic situation.

            <h3>September 2008</h3>
            <p>
              The month started with chilling news. On Monday, September 15,
              2008, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. The Dow dropped more
              than 200 points. On Tuesday, September 16, 2008, the Fed announced
              it was bailing out insurance giant American International Group
              Inc. It made an $85 billion loan in return for 79.9% equity,
              effectively taking ownership. AIG had run out of cash.

            <p>
              The Fed tried to prop up banks by lending $540 billion to money
              market funds. The funds needed the cash to meet a continuing
              barrage of redemptions. Since August, about $500 billion had been
              withdrawn from prime money markets. It purchased up to $600
              billion of certificates of deposit, banknotes, and commercial
              paper that would come due in 90 days.
